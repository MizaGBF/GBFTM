# Granblue Fantasy Thumbnail Maker  
* Tool to generate a thumbnail for Granblue Fantasy videos.  
### Requirements  
* Tested on Python 3.10.  
* [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/) to read/write the clipboard.  
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for image processing.  
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the modules.  
### Notes  
* Still in development.  
* Sister project to [GBFPIB](https://github.com/MizaGBF/GBFPIB), this tool can import data from GBF party retrieved using the GBFPIB bookmark.  
* Version 1.15 and higher can be imported into GBFPIB version 8.0 or higher.  
* Twitter API is going to be [paid-only](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922) now, so I'm dropping support for it.
